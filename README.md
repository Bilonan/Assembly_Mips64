 Vectors with a large number of zeros are called sparse vectors. They are usually stored in a special form: order vector and the vector of values. Order vector indicates that the vector coordinates take the non-zero value in the following way: the occurrence of "1" in the order vector means that the corresponding position of the vector has a value different from zero, while the occurrence of "0" means that the coordinate has a value zero. The vector of values is a vector of nonzero coordinate values of the vector. Write a program that reads the sparse vectors stored in a standardized form, converts it to the form described above and calculates the value of their scalar product (use vectors in the new form)  
 
 
 Write a program that sorts the given sequence of integers using bubble-sort algorithm.  a. Structure of the program should be as follows: "The master" is responsible for communication with the user - input and output of the program. Sorting algorithm should be implemented as a procedure called from the main module.  b. Modify the program written in paragraph (a) in such a way that swap of two elements is carried out by a procedure called by the sorting procedure.  c. What are the differences in the versions (a) and (b), of course, except for an additional procedure ?  
 
 
 
 Implement the matrix multiplication algorithm for rectangular matrices. Matrixes size can be specified in any way.  

 
 Write a program that finds all primary numbers from some specified range
